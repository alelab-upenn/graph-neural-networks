    # a B x F x N input, and while we could join together B and P into a single

    # x * aij_{e}^{k} (i.e. the multiplication between x and the kth power of

    EdgeVariantGF Creates a (linear) layer that applies an edge-variant graph

        of nodes are selected, then the remaining nodes adopt an LSI filter
        (i.e. it becomes a hybrid edge-variant grpah filter)

    Initialization:

        EdgeVariantGF(in_features, out_features, shift_taps,

                graph signal)

        Output:
            torch.nn.Module for a graph filtering layer using hybrid
                edge-variant graph filters.

        Observation: Filter taps have shape
            out_features x edge_features x shift_taps x in_features
                x number_nodes x number_nodes
            These weights are masked by the corresponding sparsity pattern of
            the graph and the desired number of selected nodes, so only weights
            in the nonzero edges of these nodes will be trained, the
            rest of the parameters contain trash. Therefore, the number of
            parameters will not reflect the actual number of parameters being
            trained.

    Add graph shift operator:

        EdgeVariantGF.addGSO(GSO) Before applying the filter, we need to define
        the GSO that we are going to use. This allows to change the GSO while
        using the same filtering coefficients (as long as the number of edge
        features is the same; but the number of nodes can change).

    GraphFilter_DB Creates a (linear) layer that applies a graph filter (i.e. a
        graph convolution) considering batches of GSO and the corresponding

        GraphFilter_DB(in_features, out_features, filter_taps,
