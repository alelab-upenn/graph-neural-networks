        Input:
            /** Graph convolutional layers **/
            dimNodeSignals (list of int): dimension of the signals at each layer
                (i.e. number of features at each node, or size of the vector
                 supported at each node)
            nFilterTaps (list of int): number of filter taps on each layer
                (i.e. nFilterTaps-1 is the extent of neighborhoods that are
                 reached, for example K=2 is info from the 1-hop neighbors)
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer
            >> Obs.: dimNodeSignals[0] is the number of features (the dimension
                of the node signals) of the data, where dimNodeSignals[l] is the
                dimension obtained at the output of layer l, l=1,...,L.
                Therefore, for L layers, len(dimNodeSignals) = L+1. Slightly
                different, nFilterTaps[l] is the number of filter taps for the
                filters implemented at layer l+1, thus len(nFilterTaps) = L.
                
            /** Activation function **/
            nonlinearity (torch.nn): module from torch.nn non-linear activations
            
            /** Pooling **/
            nSelectedNodes (list of int): number of nodes to keep after pooling
                on each layer
            >> Obs.: The selected nodes are the first nSelectedNodes[l] starting
                from the first element in the order specified by the given GSO
            >> Obs.: If coarsening = True, this variable is ignored since the
                number of nodes in each layer is given by the graph coarsening
                algorithm.
            poolingFunction (nn.Module in alegnn.utils.graphML or in torch.nn): 
                summarizing function
            >> Obs.: If coarsening = True, then the pooling function is one of
                the regular 1-d pooling functions available in torch.nn (instead
                of one of the summarizing functions in alegnn.utils.graphML).
            poolingSize (list of int): size of the neighborhood to compute the
                summary from at each layer
            >> Obs.: If coarsening = True, then the pooling size is ignored 
                since, due to the binary tree nature of the graph coarsening
                algorithm, it always has to be 2.
                
            /** Readout layers **/
            dimLayersMLP (list of int): number of output hidden units of a
                sequence of fully connected layers after the graph filters have
                been applied
                
            /** Graph structure **/
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            order (string or None, default = None): determine the criteria to
                use when reordering the nodes (i.e. for pooling reasons); the
                string has to be such that there is a function named 
                'perm' + order in alegnn.utils.graphTools that takes as input the GSO
                and returns a new GSO ordered by the specified criteria and
                an order array
            coarsening (bool, default = False): if True uses graph coarsening
                instead of zero-padding to reduce the number of nodes.
            >> Obs.: (i) Graph coarsening only works when the number
                 of edge features is 1 -scalar weights-. (ii) The graph
                 coarsening forces a given order of the nodes, and this order
                 has to be used to reordering the GSO as well as the samples
                 during training; as such, this order is internally saved and
                 applied to the incoming samples in the forward call -it is
                 thus advised to use the identity ordering in the model class
                 when using the coarsening method-.

        Output:
            nn.Module with a Selection GNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics.

    Forward call:

        SelectionGNN(x)

        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x dimFeatures x numberNodes

        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the selection
                GNN; shape: batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1]
                
    Other methods:
        
        .changeGSO(S, nSelectedNodes = [], poolingSize = []): takes as input a
        new graph shift operator S as a tensor of shape 
            (dimEdgeFeatures x) numberNodes x numberNodes
        Then, next time the SelectionGNN is run, it will run over the graph 
        with GSO S, instead of running over the original GSO S. This is 
        particularly useful when training on one graph, and testing on another
        one. The number of selected nodes and the pooling size will not change
        unless specifically consider those as input. Those lists need to have
        the same length as the number of layers. There is no need to define
        both, unless they change.
        >> Obs.: The number of nodes in the GSOs need not be the same, but
            unless we want to risk zero-padding beyond the original number
            of nodes (which just results in disconnected nodes), then we might
            want to update the nSelectedNodes and poolingSize accordingly, if
            the size of the new GSO is different.
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GNN y,
        which is of shape batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1], as well as the output
        of all the GNN layers (i.e. before the MLP layers), yGNN of shape
        batchSize x nSelectedNodes[-1] x dimFeatures[-1]. This can be used to
        isolate the effect of the graph convolutions from the effect of the
        readout layer.

        Input:

                 supported at each node)
            nFilterTaps (list of int): number of filter taps on each layer
                (i.e. nFilterTaps-1 is the extent of neighborhoods that are
                 reached, for example K=2 is info from the 1-hop neighbors)

            >> Obs.: dimNodeSignals[0] is the number of features (the dimension
                of the node signals) of the data, where dimNodeSignals[l] is the
                dimension obtained at the output of layer l, l=1,...,L.

                different, nFilterTaps[l] is the number of filter taps for the
                filters implemented at layer l+1, thus len(nFilterTaps) = L.

                from the first element in the order specified by the given GSO
            >> Obs.: If coarsening = True, this variable is ignored since the
                number of nodes in each layer is given by the graph coarsening
                algorithm.
            poolingFunction (nn.Module in alegnn.utils.graphML or in torch.nn): 
                summarizing function
            >> Obs.: If coarsening = True, then the pooling function is one of
                the regular 1-d pooling functions available in torch.nn (instead
                of one of the summarizing functions in alegnn.utils.graphML).
            poolingSize (list of int): size of the neighborhood to compute the
                summary from at each layer
            >> Obs.: If coarsening = True, then the pooling size is ignored 
                since, due to the binary tree nature of the graph coarsening
                algorithm, it always has to be 2.
                
            /** Readout layers **/
            dimLayersMLP (list of int): number of output hidden units of a

                been applied
                
            /** Graph structure **/
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            order (string or None, default = None): determine the criteria to
                use when reordering the nodes (i.e. for pooling reasons); the
                string has to be such that there is a function named 
                'perm' + order in alegnn.utils.graphTools that takes as input the GSO
                and returns a new GSO ordered by the specified criteria and
                an order array

        Output:
            nn.Module with a Selection GNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics.

    Forward call:

        LocalActivationGNN(x)

        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x dimFeatures x numberNodes

        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the selection
                GNN; shape: batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1]
                
    Other methods:
        
        .changeGSO(S, nSelectedNodes = [], poolingSize = []): takes as input a
        new graph shift operator S as a tensor of shape 
            (dimEdgeFeatures x) numberNodes x numberNodes
        Then, next time the SelectionGNN is run, it will run over the graph 
        with GSO S, instead of running over the original GSO S. This is 
        particularly useful when training on one graph, and testing on another
        one. The number of selected nodes and the pooling size will not change
        unless specifically consider those as input. Those lists need to have
        the same length as the number of layers. There is no need to define
        both, unless they change.
        >> Obs.: The number of nodes in the GSOs need not be the same, but
            unless we want to risk zero-padding beyond the original number
            of nodes (which just results in disconnected nodes), then we might
            want to update the nSelectedNodes and poolingSize accordingly, if
            the size of the new GSO is different.
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GNN y,
        which is of shape batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1], as well as the output
        of all the GNN layers (i.e. before the MLP layers), yGNN of shape
        batchSize x nSelectedNodes[-1] x dimFeatures[-1]. This can be used to
        isolate the effect of the graph convolutions from the effect of the
        readout layer.

    LocalGNN: implement the selection GNN architecture where all operations are
        implemented locally, i.e. by means of neighboring exchanges only. More
        specifically, it has graph convolutional layers, but the readout layer,
        instead of being an MLP for the entire graph signal, it is a linear
        combination of the features at each node.
        >> Obs.: This precludes the use of clustering as a pooling operation,
            since clustering is not local (it changes the given graph).

    Initialization:

        LocalGNN(dimNodeSignals, nFilterTaps, bias, # Graph Filtering
                 nonlinearity, # Nonlinearity
                 nSelectedNodes, poolingFunction, poolingSize, # Pooling
                 dimReadout, # Local readout layer
                 GSO, order = None # Structure)

        Input:
            /** Graph convolutional layers **/
            dimNodeSignals (list of int): dimension of the signals at each layer
                (i.e. number of features at each node, or size of the vector
                 supported at each node)
            nFilterTaps (list of int): number of filter taps on each layer
                (i.e. nFilterTaps-1 is the extent of neighborhoods that are
                 reached, for example K=2 is info from the 1-hop neighbors)
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer
            >> Obs.: dimNodeSignals[0] is the number of features (the dimension
                of the node signals) of the data, where dimNodeSignals[l] is the
                dimension obtained at the output of layer l, l=1,...,L.
                Therefore, for L layers, len(dimNodeSignals) = L+1. Slightly
                different, nFilterTaps[l] is the number of filter taps for the
                filters implemented at layer l+1, thus len(nFilterTaps) = L.
                
            /** Activation function **/
            nonlinearity (torch.nn): module from torch.nn non-linear activations
            
            /** Pooling **/
            nSelectedNodes (list of int): number of nodes to keep after pooling
                on each layer
            >> Obs.: The selected nodes are the first nSelectedNodes[l] starting
                from the first element in the order specified by the given GSO
            poolingFunction (nn.Module in alegnn.utils.graphML): summarizing function
            poolingSize (list of int): size of the neighborhood to compute the
                summary from at each layer
            
            /** Readout layers **/
            dimReadout (list of int): number of output hidden units of a
                sequence of fully connected layers applied locally at each node
                (i.e. no exchange of information involved).
                
            /** Graph structure **/
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            order (string or None, default = None): determine the criteria to
                use when reordering the nodes (i.e. for pooling reasons); the
                string has to be such that there is a function named 
                'perm' + order in alegnn.utils.graphTools that takes as input the GSO
                and returns a new GSO ordered by the specified criteria and
                an order array

        Output:
            nn.Module with a Local GNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics.

    Forward call:

        LocalGNN(x)

        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x dimFeatures x numberNodes

        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the selection
                GNN; shape: batchSize x dimReadout[-1] x nSelectedNodes[-1]
                
    Other methods:
        
        .changeGSO(S, nSelectedNodes = [], poolingSize = []): takes as input a
        new graph shift operator S as a tensor of shape 
            (dimEdgeFeatures x) numberNodes x numberNodes
        Then, next time the SelectionGNN is run, it will run over the graph 
        with GSO S, instead of running over the original GSO S. This is 
        particularly useful when training on one graph, and testing on another
        one. The number of selected nodes and the pooling size will not change
        unless specifically consider those as input. Those lists need to have
        the same length as the number of layers. There is no need to define
        both, unless they change.
        >> Obs.: The number of nodes in the GSOs need not be the same, but
            unless we want to risk zero-padding beyond the original number
            of nodes (which just results in disconnected nodes), then we might
            want to update the nSelectedNodes and poolingSize accordingly, if
            the size of the new GSO is different.
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GNN y,
        which is of shape batchSize x dimReadout[-1], as well as the output
        of all the GNN layers (i.e. before the readout layers), yGNN of shape
        batchSize x nSelectedNodes[-1] x dimFeatures[-1]. This can be used to
        isolate the effect of the graph convolutions from the effect of the
        readout layer.
        
        y = .singleNodeForward(x, nodes): outputs the value of the last layer
        at a single node. x is the usual input of shape batchSize x dimFeatures
        x numberNodes. nodes is either a single node (int) or a collection of
        nodes (list or numpy.array) of length batchSize, where for each element
        in the batch, we get the output at the single specified node. The
        output y is of shape batchSize x dimReadout[-1].

        Input:
            /** Graph convolutional layers **/
            dimNodeSignals (list of int): dimension of the signals at each layer
                (i.e. number of features at each node, or size of the vector
                 supported at each node)
            nCoeff (list of int): number of coefficients on each layer; if 
                nCoeff[l] is less than the size of the graph, the remaining 
                coefficients are interpolated by means of a cubic spline.
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer
            >> Obs.: dimNodeSignals[0] is the number of features (the dimension
                of the node signals) of the data, where dimNodeSignals[l] is the
                dimension obtained at the output of layer l, l=1,...,L.
                Therefore, for L layers, len(dimNodeSignals) = L+1. Slightly
                different, nCoeff[l] is the number of coefficients for the
                filters implemented at layer l+1, thus len(nCoeff) = L.
                
            
            /** Activation function **/
            nonlinearity (torch.nn): module from torch.nn non-linear activations
            
            /** Pooling **/
            nSelectedNodes (list of int): number of nodes to keep after pooling
                on each layer
            >> Obs.: The selected nodes are the first nSelectedNodes[l] starting
                from the first element in the order specified by the given GSO
            poolingFunction (nn.Module in alegnn.utils.graphML): summarizing function
            poolingSize (list of int): size of the neighborhood to compute the
                summary from at each layer
                
            
            /** Readout layers **/
            dimLayersMLP (list of int): number of output hidden units of a
                sequence of fully connected layers after the graph filters have
                been applied

            /** Graph structure **/
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            order (string or None, default = None): determine the criteria to
                use when reordering the nodes (i.e. for pooling reasons); the
                string has to be such that there is a function named 
                'perm' + order in alegnn.utils.graphTools that takes as input the GSO
                and returns a new GSO ordered by the specified criteria and
                an order array

        Output:
            nn.Module with a Selection GNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics, using filters in the spectral domain.

    Forward call:

        SpectralGNN(x)

        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x dimFeatures x numberNodes

        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the selection
                GNN; shape: batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1]
                
    Other methods:
        
        .changeGSO(S, nSelectedNodes = [], poolingSize = []): takes as input a
        new graph shift operator S as a tensor of shape 
            (dimEdgeFeatures x) numberNodes x numberNodes
        Then, next time the SelectionGNN is run, it will run over the graph 
        with GSO S, instead of running over the original GSO S. This is 
        particularly useful when training on one graph, and testing on another
        one. The number of selected nodes and the pooling size will not change
        unless specifically consider those as input. Those lists need to have
        the same length as the number of layers. There is no need to define
        both, unless they change.
        >> Obs.: This will only work if both the original GSO and the new one
            have the same number of nodes.
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GNN y,
        which is of shape batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1], as well as the output
        of all the GNN layers (i.e. before the MLP layers), yGNN of shape
        batchSize x nSelectedNodes[-1] x dimFeatures[-1]. This can be used to
        isolate the effect of the graph convolutions from the effect of the
        readout layer.

                 supported at each node)
            nShiftTaps (list of int): number of shift taps on each layer
                (i.e. information is gathered from up to the (nShiftTaps-1)-hop
                 neighborhood)

                of the hybrid EV filtering (recall that the first ones in the
                given permutation of S are the nodes selected; if any element in
                nFilterNodes is equal to the number of nodes, then we have a
                full edge-variant filter, not an hybrid one)
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer

                of the node signals) of the data, where dimNodeSignals[l] is the
                dimension obtained at the output of layer l, l=1,...,L.
                Therefore, for L layers, len(dimNodeSignals) = L+1. Slightly
                different, nShiftTaps[l] is the number of filter taps for the

            /** Readout layers **/

            /** Graph structure **/
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            order (string or None, default = None): determine the criteria to
                use when reordering the nodes (i.e. for pooling reasons); the
                string has to be such that there is a function named 
                'perm' + order in alegnn.utils.graphTools that takes as input the GSO
                and returns a new GSO ordered by the specified criteria and

    Other methods:
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GNN y,
        which is of shape batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1], as well as the output
        of all the GNN layers (i.e. before the MLP layers), yGNN of shape
        batchSize x nSelectedNodes[-1] x dimFeatures[-1]. This can be used to
        isolate the effect of graph filtering from the effect of the readout
        layer.
        
        y = .singleNodeForward(x, nodes): outputs the value of the last layer
        at a single node. x is the usual input of shape batchSize x dimFeatures
        x numberNodes. nodes is either a single node (int) or a collection of
        nodes (list or numpy.array) of length batchSize, where for each element
        in the batch, we get the output at the single specified node. The

    ARMAfilterGNN: implements the GNN architecture using ARMA graph filters
        by Jacobi's method.

    Initialization:

        ARMAfilterGNN(dimNodeSignals, nDenominatorTaps,
                      nResidueTaps, bias, # Graph Filtering

        Input:
            /** Graph filtering layers **/
            dimNodeSignals (list of int): dimension of the signals at each layer
                (i.e. number of features at each node, or size of the vector
                 supported at each node)
            nDenominatorTaps (list of int): number of filter taps in the 
                denominator polynomial at each layer
            nResidueTaps (list of int): number of filter taps in the residue
                polynomial at each layer
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer
            >> Obs.: dimNodeSignals[0] is the number of features (the dimension
                of the node signals) of the data, where dimNodeSignals[l] is the
                dimension obtained at the output of layer l, l=1,...,L.
                Therefore, for L layers, len(dimNodeSignals) = L+1. Slightly
                different, nResidueTaps[l] is the number of filter taps for the
                filters implemented at layer l+1, thus len(nResidueTaps) = L.
                Same holds for nDenominatorTaps.
            
            /** Activation function **/
            nonlinearity (torch.nn): module from torch.nn non-linear activations
            
            /** Pooling **/
            nSelectedNodes (list of int): number of nodes to keep after pooling
                on each layer
            >> Obs.: The selected nodes are the first nSelectedNodes[l] starting
                from the first element in the order specified by the given GSO
            poolingFunction (nn.Module in alegnn.utils.graphML): summarizing function
            poolingSize (list of int): size of the neighborhood to compute the
                summary from at each layer
                
            /** Readout layer **/
            dimLayersMLP (list of int): number of output hidden units of a
                sequence of fully connected layers after the graph filters have
                been applied
            
            /** Graph structure **/
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            order (string or None, default = None): determine the criteria to
                use when reordering the nodes (i.e. for pooling reasons); the
                string has to be such that there is a function named 
                'perm' + order in alegnn.utils.graphTools that takes as input the GSO
                and returns a new GSO ordered by the specified criteria and
                an order array
            
            /** Method specifics **/
            tMax (int): how many iterations in the Jacobi method (default: 5)

        Output:
            nn.Module with a Selection GNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics, implementing ARMA filters.

    Forward call:

        ARMAfilterGNN(x)

        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x dimFeatures x numberNodes

        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the GNN with
                ARMA filters; shape: batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1]
                
    Other methods:
            
        .changeGSO(S, nSelectedNodes = [], poolingSize = []): takes as input a
        new graph shift operator S as a tensor of shape 
            (dimEdgeFeatures x) numberNodes x numberNodes
        Then, next time the SelectionGNN is run, it will run over the graph 
        with GSO S, instead of running over the original GSO S. This is 
        particularly useful when training on one graph, and testing on another
        one. The number of selected nodes and the pooling size will not change
        unless specifically consider those as input. Those lists need to have
        the same length as the number of layers. There is no need to define
        both, unless they change.
        >> Obs.: The number of nodes in the GSOs need not be the same, but
            unless we want to risk zero-padding beyond the original number
            of nodes (which just results in disconnected nodes), then we might
            want to update the nSelectedNodes and poolingSize accordingly, if
            the size of the new GSO is different.
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GNN y,
        which is of shape batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1], as well as the output
        of all the GNN layers (i.e. before the MLP layers), yGNN of shape
        batchSize x nSelectedNodes[-1] x dimFeatures[-1]. This can be used to
        isolate the effect of graph filtering from the effect of the readout
        layer.

    LocalARMA: implements the selection GNN architecture using ARMA graph filters

        Input:
            /** Graph filtering layers **/
            dimNodeSignals (list of int): dimension of the signals at each layer
                (i.e. number of features at each node, or size of the vector
                 supported at each node)
            nDenominatorTaps (list of int): number of filter taps in the 
                denominator polynomial at each layer
            nResidueTaps (list of int): number of filter taps in the residue
                polynomial at each layer
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer
            >> Obs.: dimNodeSignals[0] is the number of features (the dimension
                of the node signals) of the data, where dimNodeSignals[l] is the
                dimension obtained at the output of layer l, l=1,...,L.
                Therefore, for L layers, len(dimNodeSignals) = L+1. Slightly
                different, nResidueTaps[l] is the number of filter taps for the
                filters implemented at layer l+1, thus len(nResidueTaps) = L.
                Same holds for nDenominatorTaps.
            
            /** Activation function **/
            nonlinearity (torch.nn): module from torch.nn non-linear activations
            
            /** Pooling **/
            nSelectedNodes (list of int): number of nodes to keep after pooling
                on each layer
            >> Obs.: The selected nodes are the first nSelectedNodes[l] starting
                from the first element in the order specified by the given GSO
            poolingFunction (nn.Module in alegnn.utils.graphML): summarizing function
            poolingSize (list of int): size of the neighborhood to compute the
                summary from at each layer
                
            /** Readout layer **/
            dimReadout (list of int): number of output hidden units of a
                sequence of fully connected layers applied locally at each node
                (i.e. no exchange of information involved).
            
            /** Graph structure **/
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            order (string or None, default = None): determine the criteria to
                use when reordering the nodes (i.e. for pooling reasons); the
                string has to be such that there is a function named 
                'perm' + order in alegnn.utils.graphTools that takes as input the GSO
                and returns a new GSO ordered by the specified criteria and
                an order array
            
            /** Method specifics **/
            tMax (int): how many iterations in the Jacobi method (default: 5)
        Output:
            nn.Module with a Local GNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics, implementing ARMA filters.
    Forward call:
        LocalARMA(x)
        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x dimFeatures x numberNodes
        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the GNN with
                ARMA filters; shape: 
                    batchSize x dimReadout[-1] x nSelectedNodes[-1]
                
    Other methods:
            
        .changeGSO(S, nSelectedNodes = [], poolingSize = []): takes as input a
        new graph shift operator S as a tensor of shape 
            (dimEdgeFeatures x) numberNodes x numberNodes
        Then, next time the SelectionGNN is run, it will run over the graph 
        with GSO S, instead of running over the original GSO S. This is 
        particularly useful when training on one graph, and testing on another
        one. The number of selected nodes and the pooling size will not change
        unless specifically consider those as input. Those lists need to have
        the same length as the number of layers. There is no need to define
        both, unless they change.
        >> Obs.: The number of nodes in the GSOs need not be the same, but
            unless we want to risk zero-padding beyond the original number
            of nodes (which just results in disconnected nodes), then we might
            want to update the nSelectedNodes and poolingSize accordingly, if
            the size of the new GSO is different.
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GNN y,
        which is of shape batchSize x dimLayersMLP[-1], as well as the output
        of all the GNN layers (i.e. before the MLP layers), yGNN of shape
        batchSize x nSelectedNodes[-1] x dimFeatures[-1]. This can be used to
        isolate the effect of graph filtering from the effect of the readout
        layer.
        
        y = .singleNodeForward(x, nodes): outputs the value of the last layer
        at a single node. x is the usual input of shape batchSize x dimFeatures
        x numberNodes. nodes is either a single node (int) or a collection of
        nodes (list or numpy.array) of length batchSize, where for each element
        in the batch, we get the output at the single specified node. The
        output y is of shape batchSize x dimReadout[-1].

        Input:

                multi-node aggregation GNN; shape:

    Example:
        
    We want to create a Multi-Node GNN with two outer layers (i.e. two rounds of
    exchanging information on the graph). In the first round, we select 10 
    nodes, and in the following round, we select 5. Then, we need to determine
    how many shifts (how further away) we are going to move information around.
    In the first round (first outer layer) we shift around 4 times, and in the
    second round, we shift around 8 times (i.e. we get info from up to the 
    4-hop neighborhood in the first round, and 8-hop neighborhood in the
    secound round.)

    nSelectedNodes = [10, 5]
    nShifts = [4, 8]
    
    At this point, we have finished determining the outer structure (the one
    that involves exchanging information with neighbors). Now, we need to
    determine how to process the data within each node (the aggregation GNN
    that happens at each node). Since we have two outer layers, each of these
    parameters will be a list containing two lists. Each of these two lists
    determines the parameters to use to process internally the data. All nodes
    will use the same structure during each round.
    
    Say that we step inside a single node. We start with the signal received
    at the first outer layer (r=0), i.e., we have a signal of length 
    nShifts[0] = 4. We want to process this signal with a two-layer CNN creating
    3 and 6 features, respectively, using 2 filter taps, and with a ReLU
    nonlinearity in between and a max-pooling of size 2. This will just give
    an output with 6 features. This processing occurs at all 
    nSelectedNodes[0] = 10 nodes. After the second round, we get a new signal,
    with 6 features, but of length nShifts[1] = 8 at each of the
    nSelectedNodes[1] = 5 nodes. Now we want to process it through a two-layer
    CNN with that creates 12 and 18 features, with filters of size 2, with
    ReLU nonlinearities (same as before) and a max pooling (same as before) of 
    size 2. The setting is
    
    dimFeatures = [[1, 3, 6], [6, 12, 18]]
    nFilterTaps = [[2, 2], [2, 2]]
    nonlinearity = nn.ReLU
    poolingFunction = nn.MaxPool1d
    poolingSize = [[2, 2], [2, 2]]
    
    Recall that between the last convolutional layer (internal) and the output
    to be shared across nodes, there is an MLP layer adapting the number of
    features to the expected number of features of the next layer.
    
    Once we have all dimFeatures[-1][-1] = 18 features, collected at all
    nSelectedNodes[-1] = 5, we collect this information in a vector and feed it
    through two fully-connected layers of size 20 and 10.

    """
    GraphRecurrentNN: implements the GRNN architecture. It is a single-layer 
    GRNN and the hidden state is initialized at random drawing from a standard 
    gaussian.
    
    Initialization:
        
        GraphRecurrentNN(dimInputSignals, dimOutputSignals,
                            dimHiddenSignals, nFilterTaps, bias, # Filtering

                            GSO)
        
        Input:
            /** Graph convolutions **/
            dimInputSignals (int): dimension of the input signals
            dimOutputSignals (int): dimension of the output signals
            dimHiddenSignals (int): dimension of the hidden state
            nFilterTaps (list of int): a list with two elements, the first one
                is the number of filter taps for the filters in the hidden
                state equation, the second one is the number of filter taps
                for the filters in the output
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer
            
            /** Activation functions **/
            nonlinearityHidden (torch.function): the nonlinearity to apply
                when computing the hidden state; it has to be a torch function,
                not a nn.Module
            nonlinearityOutput (torch.function): the nonlinearity to apply when
                computing the output signal; it has to be a torch function, not
                a nn.Module.
            nonlinearityReadout (nn.Module): the nonlinearity to apply at the
                end of the readout layer (if the readout layer has more than
                one layer); this one has to be a nn.Module, instead of just a
                torch function.
                
            /** Readout layer **/
            dimReadout (list of int): number of output hidden units of a
                sequence of fully connected layers applied locally at each node
                (i.e. no exchange of information involved).
                
            /** Graph structure **/
            dimEdgeFeatures (int): number of edge features
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            
        Output:
            nn.Module with a GRNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics
            
    Forward call:
        
        GraphRecurrentNN(x)
        
        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x timeSamples x dimInputSignals x numberNodes

        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the GRNN; 
                batchSize x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1] x numberNodes
        
    Other methods:
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GRNN y,
        which has shape batchSize x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1] x numberNodes,
        as well as the output of the GRNN (i.e. before the readout layers), 
        yGNN of shape batchSize x timeSamples x dimInputSignals x numberNodes. 
        This can be used to isolate the effect of the graph convolutions from 
        the effect of the readout layer.
        
        y = .singleNodeForward(x, nodes): outputs the value of the last
        layer at a single node. x is the usual input of shape batchSize 
        x timeSamples x dimInputSignals x numberNodes. nodes is either a single
        node (int) or a collection of nodes (list or numpy.array) of length
        batchSize, where for each element in the batch, we get the output at
        the single specified node. The output y is of shape batchSize 
        x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1].
        
        .changeGSO(S): takes as input a new graph shift operator S as a tensor of shape 
            (dimEdgeFeatures x) numberNodes x numberNodes
        Then, next time the GraphRecurrentNN is run, it will run over the graph 
        with GSO S, instead of running over the original GSO S. This is 
        particularly useful when training on one graph, and testing on another
        one.
        >> Obs.: The number of nodes in the GSOs need not be the same.

   GatedGraphRecurrentNN: implements the (time, node, edge)-gated GRNN 
   architecture. It is a single-layer gated GRNN and the hidden state is 
   initialized at random drawing from a standard gaussian.
    
    Initialization:
        
        GatedGraphRecurrentNN(dimInputSignals, dimOutputSignals,
                            dimHiddenSignals, nFilterTaps, bias, # Filtering

        Input:
            /** Graph convolutions **/
            dimInputSignals (int): dimension of the input signals
            dimOutputSignals (int): dimension of the output signals
            dimHiddenSignals (int): dimension of the hidden state
            nFilterTaps (list of int): a list with two elements, the first one
                is the number of filter taps for the filters in the hidden
                state equation, the second one is the number of filter taps
                for the filters in the output
            bias (bool): include bias after graph filter on every layer
            
            /** Activation functions **/
            nonlinearityHidden (torch.function): the nonlinearity to apply
                when computing the hidden state; it has to be a torch function,
                not a nn.Module
            nonlinearityOutput (torch.function): the nonlinearity to apply when
                computing the output signal; it has to be a torch function, not
                a nn.Module.
            nonlinearityReadout (nn.Module): the nonlinearity to apply at the
                end of the readout layer (if the readout layer has more than
                one layer); this one has to be a nn.Module, instead of just a
                torch function.
                
            /** Readout layer **/
            dimReadout (list of int): number of output hidden units of a
                sequence of fully connected layers applied locally at each node
                (i.e. no exchange of information involved).
                
            /** Graph structure **/
            dimEdgeFeatures (int): number of edge features
            GSO (np.array): graph shift operator of choice.
            
            /** Gating **/
            gateType (string): 'time', 'node' or 'edge' gating
            
            
        Output:
            nn.Module with a gated GRNN architecture with the above specified
            characteristics
            
    Forward call:
        
        GatedGraphRecurrentNN(x)
        
        Input:
            x (torch.tensor): input data of shape
                batchSize x timeSamples x dimInputSignals x numberNodes

        Output:
            y (torch.tensor): output data after being processed by the GRNN; 
                batchSize x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1] x numberNodes
        
    Other methods:
            
        y, yGNN = .splitForward(x): gives the output of the entire GRNN y,
        which has shape batchSize x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1] x numberNodes,
        as well as the output of the GRNN (i.e. before the readout layers), 
        yGNN of shape batchSize x timeSamples x dimInputSignals x numberNodes. 
        This can be used to isolate the effect of the graph convolutions from 
        the effect of the readout layer.
        
        y = .singleNodeForward(x, nodes): outputs the value of the last
        layer at a single node. x is the usual input of shape batchSize 
        x timeSamples x dimInputSignals x numberNodes. nodes is either a single
        node (int) or a collection of nodes (list or numpy.array) of length
        batchSize, where for each element in the batch, we get the output at
        the single specified node. The output y is of shape batchSize 
        x timeSamples x dimReadout[-1].
        
        .changeGSO(S): takes as input a new graph shift operator S as a tensor of shape 
            (dimEdgeFeatures x) numberNodes x numberNodes
        Then, next time the GatedGraphRecurrentNN is run, it will run over the graph 
        with GSO S, instead of running over the original GSO S. This is 
        particularly useful when training on one graph, and testing on another
        one.
        >> Obs.: The number of nodes in the GSOs need not be the same.
